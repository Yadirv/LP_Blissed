                                    <p class="leading-relaxed text-sm">Individual results may vary. The results described in testimonials, reviews, before-and-after photos, and marketing materials represent individual experiences and outcomes that are not typical. Results from using Blissed Skin products depend on many variables, including: individual skin type (oily, dry, combination, sensitive), existing skin conditions and severity, age and genetic factors, consistency and frequency of product use, overall skincare routine and habits, diet, hydration, and lifestyle factors, environmental factors (climate, pollution, sun exposure), and stress levels and sleep quality. We make no guarantees, warranties, or representations that you will achieve specific results from using our products. Testimonials and reviews on our website represent real experiences from actual customers, but they are not scientifically proven or verified, do not constitute endorsements or recommendations, may not be representative of typical results, and have not been evaluated by the FDA. While some users may notice improvements quickly, skincare results typically require consistent use over several weeks or months, patience and realistic expectations, time for skin cell turnover and regeneration, and 4-8 weeks minimum to see noticeable changes (varies by product and individual).</p>

                                    <p class="leading-relaxed text-sm">Blissed Skin products contain various active and inactive ingredients that may cause allergic reactions or sensitivities in some individuals. Before using our products: read the complete ingredient list on product packaging and our website, identify potential allergens if you have known allergies or sensitivities, perform a patch test before applying to larger areas (especially face), and discontinue use immediately if you experience any adverse reaction. While we formulate with safety in mind, our products may contain ingredients that some people are sensitive to, including fragrances (natural or synthetic), essential oils, botanical extracts, preservatives, alpha hydroxy acids (AHAs), beta hydroxy acids (BHAs), retinoids or retinol derivatives, niacinamide, and vitamin C derivatives. Stop using the product immediately and consult a healthcare professional if you experience redness, itching, burning sensation, hives, rash, welts, swelling of face, lips, tongue, or throat, difficulty breathing or swallowing, severe or persistent irritation, peeling, blistering, broken skin, or any unusual or concerning symptoms. To perform a patch test: apply a small amount of product to your inner forearm or behind your ear, wait 24-48 hours without washing the area, check for any redness, itching, swelling, or irritation. If no reaction occurs, the product is likely safe for you to use. If a reaction occurs, do not use the product and consult a healthcare professional.</p>

                            <h2 class="font-playfair text-2xl font-bold text-blissed-gray mb-4">Dispute Resolution</h2>
                            <p class="mb-3 leading-relaxed">In the event of a dispute, we encourage you to contact us first to seek an informal resolution. Most concerns can be resolved quickly and amicably through direct communication.</p>
                            <p class="mb-2 font-semibold text-blissed-gray text-sm">Informal Resolution:</p>
                            <p class="mb-3 text-sm leading-relaxed">Before initiating formal dispute resolution procedures, you agree to contact us at legal@blissedskin.com and provide a detailed description of the dispute. We will attempt to resolve the dispute informally by contacting you via email. If a dispute is not resolved within 30 days after submission, you or Blissed Skin may initiate formal dispute resolution (mediation or arbitration).</p>
                            <p class="mb-2 font-semibold text-blissed-gray text-sm">Mediation:</p>
                            <p class="mb-3 text-sm leading-relaxed">If informal resolution is unsuccessful, both parties agree to participate in good faith mediation before pursuing arbitration or litigation. Mediation will be conducted by a neutral third-party mediator. Each party will bear its own costs of mediation. If the dispute is not resolved through mediation within 60 days, either party may proceed to arbitration.</p>
                            <p class="mb-2 font-semibold text-blissed-gray text-sm">Arbitration:</p>
                            <p class="mb-3 text-sm leading-relaxed">If mediation is unsuccessful, any remaining dispute shall be resolved by binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) in accordance with its Consumer Arbitration Rules. The arbitration will be conducted in [County], [State], or another mutually agreed location, or remotely via telephone or videoconference if both parties agree. The arbitrator's decision will be final and binding, and judgment on the award may be entered in any court with jurisdiction. The arbitrator may award attorney's fees and costs to the prevailing party if authorized by law.</p>
                            <p class="mb-2 font-semibold text-blissed-gray text-sm">Class Action Waiver:</p>
                            <p class="mb-3 text-sm leading-relaxed">You agree that any dispute resolution proceedings, whether in mediation, arbitration, or court, will be conducted only on an individual basis and not as part of a class, consolidated, or representative action. You may not consolidate your dispute with claims of any other person or entity.</p>
                            <p class="mb-2 font-semibold text-blissed-gray text-sm">Exceptions:</p>
                            <p class="mb-3 text-sm leading-relaxed">Either party may seek injunctive or other equitable relief in court to protect intellectual property rights (trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets). Either party may bring a claim in small claims court if it qualifies and remains in small claims court. Claims related to personal injury or property damage may be brought in court rather than arbitration.</p>
                            <p class="mb-2 font-semibold text-blissed-gray text-sm">Costs and Fees:</p>
                            <p class="mb-3 text-sm leading-relaxed">For arbitration claims under $10,000, Blissed Skin will pay all arbitration filing fees and arbitrator fees. For claims exceeding $10,000, fees will be allocated according to AAA rules. Each party will bear its own attorney's fees unless the arbitrator awards them to the prevailing party as permitted by law.</p>
                            <p class="mb-2 font-semibold text-blissed-gray text-sm">Opt-Out:</p>
                            <p class="text-sm leading-relaxed">You may opt out of this arbitration agreement by sending written notice to Blissed Skin LLC at [Address] within 30 days of your first purchase or account creation, whichever is earlier. Your opt-out notice must include your name, address, email, and a clear statement that you wish to opt out of the arbitration agreement.</p>
